# Popular Movies App
Project Overview

In this project, I build an app to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing.

# Features
The app shows grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.
Allow your user to change sort order via a setting by most popular or by highest-rated
Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:
* original title
* movie poster image thumbnail
* A plot synopsis (called overview in the api)
* user rating (called vote_average in the api)
* release date
* view and play trailers ( either in the youtube app or a web browser).
* read reviews of a selected movie.
* mark a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping a button(star).

The app stores the names and ids of the user's favorite movies and display their favorites collection while offline.
